# Blockchain-Based-genomic-data-management-System
This project focuses on leveraging the power of blockchain to develop a robust and transparent platform for handling patient data securely. By employing smart contracts, the system ensures that only authorized individuals, such as doctors and patients themselves, can access and manage the sensitive medical information. Through decentralized patient data management, the project aims to address concerns related to data breaches, privacy violations, and the lack of transparency in traditional healthcare systems.
